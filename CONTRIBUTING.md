## Code Style Guide

### Python Code Style

Follow PEP 8 and the Google Python Style Guide:

```python
# Good example ✅
class MyClass:
    """A brief description of the class.

    A more detailed description...
    """

    def my_method(self, param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> str:
        """A brief description of the method.

        Args:
            param1: Description of parameter 1.
            param2: Description of parameter 2.

        Returns:
            Description of the return value.
        """
        pass

# Bad example ❌
class myclass:  # Class names should be PascalCase
    def MyMethod(self,param1,param2=10):  # Method names should be snake_case
        pass  # Missing docstring
```

### Type Hinting

Use Python type hints:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any

async def process_messages(
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    max_tokens: Optional[int] = None
) -> str:
    """Process a list of messages."""
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features.
- Keep tests simple and clear.
- Ensure tests cover critical paths.

```python
import pytest
from mini_agent.tools.my_tool import MyTool

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_tool():
    """Test the custom tool."""
    tool = MyTool()
    result = await tool.execute(param="test")
    assert result.success
    assert "expected" in result.content
```
